# FlySwatter

Fly Swatter is a game I made for fun as I've been practicing using Angular, even though Angular is not meant to be used for making games. I tried to replicate Fly Swatter from Super Mario Paint for the SNES. Here's a link to a video of how the original game was like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAQXJbfihxo. The game is meant to be played using a mouse. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.
